# template-literals
A simple tool to convert template literals to normal strings

## How to use?
The easiest way is to visit [https://swiatekf361.github.io/template-literals](https://swiatekf361.github.io/template-literals), paste your code and hit Convert.

If you want, read a [changelog](https://github.com/swiatekf361/template-literals/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). _(you don't want)_

## Issues?
Of course they are! If you find any, let me know by creating a new issue. 

## Contributions? 
I guess you have many better activities to do than fixing my code, but if you accidentally fixed something don't be afraid to create a pull request (or issue).
